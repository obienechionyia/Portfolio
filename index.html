          Hi! I'm Obi. I'm a full-stack web developer. Thanks for visiting my

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a former professional basketball player turned self-taught,
          full-stack web developer with experience in Javascript, React.js,
          Node.js, Python, Django, HTML, and CSS. After attending Temple
          University for four years on a basketball scholarship, I decided to
          jump head-first into software development. It has a been a passion of
          mine since high school, and I always knew I would start my career in
          it after finishing my athletic career. I made it my goal over the last
          few years to be able to build functional websites and applications;
          you can see the results of the work I put in here in my portfolio.
          Thanks for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy my personal projects
          below!
